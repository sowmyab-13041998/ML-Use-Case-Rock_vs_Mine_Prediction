# ML-Use-Case-Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
## Introduction

There is war is going on between two countries submarine of the country is going under the water to another country and enemy country planted some mines in the oceans mine are nothing but explosive that explodes when some object comes in contact with it and there can be rocks in the ocean so submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing mine or rock our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock. So how this is done is submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks so this signal in the processed to detect whether the object is a mine or it's just a rock in the ocean to predict the rock and mine we use Logistic Regression. 

This is about predicting SONAR rocks against Mines with the help of Machine Learning. 
SONAR is an abbreviated form of Sound Navigation and Ranging. It uses sound waves to detect objects underwater. Machine learning-based tactics, and deep learning-based approaches have applications in detecting sonar signals and hence targets.
